# File-Management-and-Linked-Lists-
Final Project in C class
 
 For this project you should write a doubly linked list program that implements Insert, Member, Delete, and
Free_list, stores a list of strings, and stores the strings in increasing alphabetical order. Your program should
not store duplicate strings, and it should be efficient in the following two senses:
1. It minimizes the use of memory for the list. So the individual nodes in the list only store as many characters
as are actually in the string (including the terminating null character).
2. It minimizes search times by exploiting the alphabetical ordering in the list. So Insert, Member, and Delete
only search through the list as far as needed.
